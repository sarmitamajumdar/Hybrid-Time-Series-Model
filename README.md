# When Old Meets New: Hybrid Time Series Models That Predict the Future  

**Subtitle:** *The thrilling marriage of classical statistics and deep learning in forecasting everything from markets to medicine*  

---

## Introduction  

Time series forecasting is everywhere — from **stock markets** to **ICU patient monitoring**.  
Traditional models like **ARIMA** give interpretability and mathematical elegance.  
Deep learning models like **LSTM** and **Transformers** give raw predictive power.  

But real-world data is **messy, nonlinear, noisy**. That’s why the future belongs to **Hybrid Models**:  
*Statistical wisdom + Deep learning intelligence*

## What Are Hybrid Models?  

Hybrid models **combine two or more forecasting approaches** to capture what single models miss.  

### Benefits:  
- Capture **linear + nonlinear** patterns  
- Handle **noise & missing values** better  
- Improve **accuracy & resilience**  
- Balance **interpretability + power**

## Real-World Examples  

| **Industry** | **Hybrid Approach** | **Impact** |
|--------------|---------------------|------------|
| Finance      | ARIMA + LSTM        | Reduced risk in stock forecasting |
| Energy       | Wavelet + LSTM      | Fewer blackouts in power grids |
| Healthcare   | Kalman + RNN        | Early detection of ICU anomalies |
| Retail       | Prophet + Transformer | Smarter inventory planning |
| Climate      | CNN + LSTM          | Better extreme weather predictions |

## The Hybrid Blueprint  

**Example:** ARIMA + LSTM  
1. **ARIMA** handles linear trends & seasonality  
2. **LSTM** models nonlinear residuals  
3. **Final hybrid** = ARIMA prediction + LSTM correction
